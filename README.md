# Exotics Ecosse
Exotics Ecosse is a high end car rental company where you can hire SUV's, Luxury cars, and Supercars for days, weeks, or months.
While catering to the car enthusiast who can experience the thrill of driving some of the fastest and most powerfull cars in the world,
it's also for the businessman who wants to impress a client, or for people attending a special event like a wedding or an anniversary,
or simply to treat themselves.
There is also the instagram generation market, where people want to upload pictures of themselves surrounded by expensive trinketry to
show the world that they are leading their 'best life'!
Exotic cars are expensive to buy, keep, and run, so Exotics Ecosse has the facility for owners of such vehicles to rent their's out
to help with these costs.
They can register as a vehicle owner to become a super user, and this gives them access to add, edit, and delete their vehicle 
from the site if and when they choose.

## UX
Users of Exotics Ecosse will find a simple to use, intuative layout with clearly defined task buttons to take them directly to the 
category of vehicles they are interested in. Alternativley there is a search facility to look for a specific vehicle or they can
select to browse all of the categories of available vehicles. Once into the vehicle category it's then a quick and easy process
to select a vehicle and get through to the cart and checkout area's. Users who register for an account will have access to their
own profile page which allows them to save their details which will make future bookings even faster, and also allow them to
see their previous bookings in their order history.

## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
