# Exotics Ecosse
Exotics Ecosse is a high end car rental company where you can hire SUV's, Luxury cars, and Supercars for days, weeks, or months.
While catering to the real car enthusiast who can experience the thrill of driving some of the fastest and most powerfull cars in the world.
It's also for the businessman who wants to impress a client, or for people attending a special event like a wedding or an anniversary,
or simply to treat themselves.
There is also the instagram generation market, where people want to upload pictures of themselves surrounded by expensive trinketry to
show the world that they are leading their 'best life'!
Exotic cars are expensive to buy, keep, and run, so Exotics Ecosse has the facility for owners of such to make their vehicles available
for hire to help with these ownership costs.
They can register as a vehicle owner to become a super user, and this gives them access to add, edit, and delete their vehicle 
from the site if and when they choose.

## UX
Users of Exotics Ecosse will find a simple to use, intuative layout with clearly defined task buttons to take them directly to the 
category of vehicles they are interested in. Alternativley there is a search facility to look for a specific vehicle or they can
select to browse all of the categories of available vehicles. Once into the vehicle category it's then a quick and easy process
to select a vehicle and get through to the cart and checkout area's. Users who register for an account will have access to their
own profile page which allows them to save their details which will make future bookings even faster, and also allow them to
see their previous bookings in their order history.

## Testing
I have run testing on:
Chrome developer tools
W3C Validator for HTML
W3C Validator for CSS
JSHint for javascript 
Idle for Python

It has been tested on
Google Chrome
Firefox
Safari

It has been checked on these screen sizes and renders well on all.
Desktop
Laptop
Ipad
Iphone


Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

## Deployment
The deployed link for the site is: https://pt70-exotics-ecosse.herokuapp.com/

This site was created using GITPOD, stored in GITHUB, and deployed through HEROKU.

You can clone this project from this repository by,

Clicking on the "clone or download" button at the top right Copy the URL Change the current working directory
to the location of your clone directory Enter git clone and paste in the URL: https://github.com/PT-70/exotics_ecosse.git

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

## Credits
### Content
I received inspiration for this project from the final module in the code institute full stack developer course and as 
such used it as my template.
### Media
The photos used in this site were obtained from Google Images.
### Acknowledgements
The colour scheme for this project was inspired by the TV advertisement for 'G-Tech' products, which I think has a clean sharp look.
